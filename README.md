# KAPESIT: Kiruthik’s Artificial Prediction Engine for Space and Intelligent Technology

### Project Overview

**KAPESIT** is an open-source project aimed at solving a critical challenge faced by space robotics: predicting dips and adjusting robotic movement dynamically to avoid potential disruptions. This project leverages neural networks and AI-driven technologies to anticipate dips in walking robots and adjust movements accordingly, providing a cost-effective solution to a problem faced by organizations like the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

This project is designed to be developed with a zero budget, using free tools, simulators, and open-source platforms. Our goal is not only to contribute a meaningful solution to space research but also to advance knowledge and skill in space science, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

### Project Goals

- **Predict Robotic Dips**: Develop a neural network that can accurately predict dips while a robot is walking, allowing the robot to adjust its movement to maintain balance.
- **Zero-Budget**: Achieve this solution using no-cost resources, relying solely on open-source tools and simulation environments.
- **Practical Learning**: Enhance our understanding of space science and robotics by working on a real-world problem.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Provide a fully open-source project to benefit the wider community, though the main focus remains on achieving the project goals.

### Key Features

- **Neural Network-Based Prediction**: Using AI techniques (LSTM, CNN, or a combination) to predict dips in the robot’s trajectory.
- **Data Simulation**: All training data is generated through simulated environments to avoid hardware costs.
- **Open Source**: The project is hosted on GitHub to allow for collaboration and transparency.
- **Focus on Space Science**: This project is aligned with solving real-world problems in space robotics, inspired by ISRO's requirements.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Simulation**: 
   - We simulate the robotic movement using open-source platforms like Gazebo or Webots to generate synthetic data that represents real-world dips and environmental changes.
   
2. **Neural Network Training**:
   - Neural network models will be built using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and trained on the simulated data to predict dips in real-time.
   
3. **Validation & Testing**:
   - Continuous testing in simulated environments to fine-tune the model and improve prediction accuracy.
   
4. **Deployment**:
   - Once trained and tested, the model will be deployed in a simulated environment for real-time predictions. Future work could include deploying the model on actual robotic hardware.
