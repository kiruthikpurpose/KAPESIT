# KAPESIT

### Project Overview

**KAPESIT (Kiruthik’s Artificial Prediction Engine for Space and Intelligent Technology)** is my personal open-source, AI-driven project designed to address a fundamental challenge in space robotics: predicting dips in a robot's path and adjusting movement in real-time to maintain balance. By using advanced neural networks and AI techniques, **KAPESIT** aims to create a robust solution that can operate in extreme environments like the moon, Mars, and beyond. This project simulates real-world conditions, such as rough terrain, and trains AI models to help space robots adapt and avoid falls or instability.

My ultimate objective is to use open-source technologies and no-cost tools to develop a solution that aligns with the needs of space research organizations like ISRO, while also contributing to the broader field of space science and robotics.

### Project Goals

- **Predict Robotic Dips in Real-Time**: Build a neural network model capable of analyzing terrain data in real-time and predicting potential dips to enable corrective actions.
- **Cost-Effective Development**: Achieve the entire project with a zero-budget approach, relying on freely available resources, simulators, and open-source software.
- **Space Science Learning**: Use this project as a practical exercise in understanding space science, AI, robotics, and their intersection.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Make the project open-source to allow others to contribute and learn from it, even though it is a solo-driven initiative.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Neural Networks**: Experiment with various neural network architectures like CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, and hybrid models to find the optimal approach for predicting dips in robotic movement.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Implement RL algorithms to help robots learn from their environment and improve performance over time.
- **Dynamic Terrain Mapping**: Create dynamic maps of the environment that can be used to train robots on different terrains (e.g., moon surface, Mars, uneven Earth terrains).
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms**: Explore how robots can recover from minor falls and self-correct while walking, based on learned behavior from the neural network model.
- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: Enable simulations with multiple robotic agents interacting with one another to explore collaborative movement and dip avoidance.
- **Continuous Learning**: Incorporate mechanisms for continual learning so that the robot's performance improves with more data from different environments.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Simulation**: 
   - Simulate robotic movement using open-source platforms like Gazebo or Webots. These simulations will generate synthetic data representing real-world dips and environmental changes.
   - Use procedural generation techniques to create various types of terrains (rocky, flat, craters) to diversify the dataset.

2. **Neural Network Training**:
   - Build neural network models using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Train models on simulated data using free cloud resources (e.g., Google Colab) for GPU/TPU acceleration.
   - Experiment with different model architectures to determine which one performs best for real-time dip prediction.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Implement reinforcement learning algorithms to help robots adapt dynamically to new terrains without pre-trained knowledge, adjusting their movements based on reward feedback.
   - Use RL environments like OpenAI Gym or create custom environments tailored to space exploration scenarios.

4. **Validation & Testing**:
   - Continuously test models in different simulated environments to fine-tune prediction accuracy.
   - Compare performance across various neural network models to identify the best-performing configuration.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Once trained and tested, the model will be deployed in a simulated environment for real-time predictions. 
   - Future work could involve deploying the model on actual robotic hardware in collaboration with research organizations.
